# Obsidian Note Switcher Plug in 


This Plug in provides the posibiltiy to move through notes within the choosen or all folders in the Vault. 
The function is specially helpful if you want to quickly review the notes in the folder for cleanup, maybe after importing notes from other sources.


Switching between Notes works with hotkeys. 
Default hotkeys: 
- Next note = CMD (CTRL) + j
- Previous note = CMD (CTRL) + k

You can reassign the hotkeys via the Obsidian preferences -> Hotkeys
Your have the possiblity to choose your folder in which the plugin moves between the notes. 

One watchout! The plugin will not necessary move in the sequence shown in the folder explorer. It will at this point strictly follow the name sorting.
